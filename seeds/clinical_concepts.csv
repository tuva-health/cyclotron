Scope note: The term ""use disorder"" with regard to psychoactive substances has become widespread since its adoption in DSM-5 in 2013.  By design, the phrase is intended to subsume the disease concepts of ""abuse"" and ""dependence"" of a psychoactive substance.  Not all use of a psychoactive substance meets the diagnostic criteria for use disorder, so this value set may not identify all individuals who are known to their health care team to use alcohol.  In addition, the diagnosis of a ""use disorder"" does not definitively indicate current use of the substance, as the diagnosis (with the qualification of ""in remission"") applies to individuals who are abstinent, even on a long-term basis, after having previously met the criteria for the use disorder.  Note also that individuals with health conditions caused by alcohol may not be captured by this value set as they may not meet the criteria of alcohol use disorder, particularly if they had an idiosyncratic response to a low or moderate level of alcohol consumption.","Candidate codes were identified for review based on search terms:

The significance of this scope is that these are thromboses that pose a particular risk for pulmonary embolism.

Included:
1. Thrombosis of any ""deep vein"" in the upper extremity, described as a ""deep vein"" or with reference to the specific vein (including the brachial, axillary, and/or subclavian veins)
2. Thrombosis of any ""deep vein"" in the lower extremity, whether proximal or distal to the knee, described as a ""deep vein"" or with reference to the specific vein (including the common femoral vein, deep femoral vein, femoral vein, popliteal vein, peroneal vein, anterior and posterior tibial veins, and so-called ""muscular veins of the calf"")

4. Thrombosis of a central vein, so described or naming the specific vein (including the brachiocephalic, subclavian, and common and external iliac veins, as well as the superior and inferior vena cava).

Notes-
1. Codes using the phrasing of ""embolism and thrombosis of <deep vein>"" are considered in scope.
2. While ""thrombophlebitis"" implies thrombosis (with the added pathophysiologic feature of inflammation), terms phrased as ""phlebitis and thrombophlebitis"" imply a scope that includes both thrombophlebitis and isolated inflammation of a vein without thrombos (i.e. ""phlebitis"").  Since such codes do not necessarily imply the presence of thrombosis, they are not considered in scope.


Not included-Any of the following without assertion of one of the conditions in the ""included"" list above:
1. Venous thrombosis or thromboembolism without specification of deep vein involvement
2. Cerebral venous thrombosis.  This condition is generally considered as distinct from DVT of the extremities or pelvis, primarily because a) it does not pose the same risk for pulmonary embolism as extremity or pelvic DVT, and also b) the risk factors are somewhat distinct and b) not all cerebral veins are considered ""deep veins"".
3. Retinal vein occlusion, for the same reasons as #2 above

It does not include fractures of the acetabulum, despite the acetabulum being part of the hip joint, since such fractures are distinct in terms of epidemiology, injury mechanism, and treatment, and are generally not referred to by the term ""hip fracture"".

Note that the scope includes two subtypes of hip fracture (#s 8 and 9 below) which may not correspond to the clinical intent of identifying ""hip fracture"" for some use cases, since they occur exclusively in young individuals (#8) or because they tend to be associated with vigorous physical activity rather than minor trauma in frail and/or osteoporotic individuals.  If needed, a separate value set could be created excluding those hip fracture subtypes.

Included:
1. Any assertion of ""hip fracture"".
2. Any assertion of fracture of the ""proximal femur"", since that term, in both SNOMED-CT and the Foundational Model of Anatomy, does not include the femoral shaft and thus would conform to the general scope described above.

59,Chronic Kidney Disease,reviewed,,2024-04-05,,condition,Tuva-developed,,"Comment:
The phrase ""chronic kidney disease"" (CKD) has been, for several decades, used to describe a process that can have many different causes, progresses through recognizable stages over time, and has major significance for public health.  International consensus guidelines have been established which define CKD and classify it based on glomerular filtration rate (which measures the filtering capacity of the kidneys), albuminuria (which measures the degree of abnormal excretion of protein in the urine), and cause.  This term is sometimes used interchangeably with ""chronic renal [or ""kidney""] failure [or ""insufficiency""]""

There are many, many conditions that may result in the clinical entity of ""CKD"" as described above, but which in and of themselves do not imply the presence of progressive deterioration in GFR, albuminuria, or both.  For this reason, the scope of this concept will be tightly defined to situations where CKD is explicitly asserted.  However, it is possible for a patient to have CKD and

66,Hypertension,reviewed,,2024-04-09,,condition,Tuva-developed,,"Included:
1. The intent of the scope is to include all assertions of arterial hypertension in the systemic (i.e. non-pulmonary) circulation.  The word ""hypertension"" simply means elevated pressure, and thus, ""arterial hypertension"" means elevated pressure in a patient's arteries.  ""Hypertension"" may refer elevated pressure in locations other than the arteries, e.g. the patient's veins (""venous hypertension"") or inside the cranial cavity (""intracranial hypertension"").  However, the use of the word ""hypertension"" with no other qualifier, by convention, refers to arterial hypertension, and will be taken as such.

Elevated arterial pressure becomes a significant threat to health when it occurs frequently or constantly over a sustained period of time, and in fact, the term ""hypertension"" implies a sustained effect rather than brief, isolated episodes of increased pressure.

2. Hypertension can occur in pregnancy, with either onset prior to the pregnancy (""chronic hypertension"") or during the pregnancy.  When it starts during the pregnancy, it may occur as a temporary phenomenon that resolves after the end of the pregnancy, or can persist after the end of the pregnancy.  The label ""gestational hypertension"" is often used to describe the latter condition.  Gestational hypertension, and other labels to describe hypertension occurring during pregnancy, will be included in this concept.


Not included-Any of the following without assertion of one of the conditions in the ""included"" list above:
1. Mentions of elevated blood pressure without an assertion of ""hypertension"".
2. ""Hypertension"" with some specifier indicating it is not arterial hypertension (e.g. ""intracranial hypertension"").
3. Assertions of complications of arterial hypertension, e.g. hypertensive retinopathy or ""hypertensive chronic kidney disease"".  While such conditions, by definition, cannot occur in the absence of hypertension, it is possible for them to occur, and persist, in an individual whose hypertension resolved (e.g. as the result of changes in lifestyle).  If a use case calls for identifying any patient who may have had arterial hypertension at any time in the past, a concept ""complications of hypertension"" could be created.
4. Assertions of use of antihypertensive medications, since such medications can be used to treat other conditions.
5. Pulmonary hypertension, since this does not involve the systemic circulation.
6. ""Post-procedural"" hypertension.  This is an exception to the convention that ""hypertension"" implies sustained elevations in blood pressure over extended periods of time, as it refers to the time frame immediately following a health care procedure.","Candidate codes were identified for review based on ""contains"" searches for:

67,"Lung cancer, primary or unspecified",reviewed,,2024-04-10,,condition,Tuva-developed,,"The intent of this concept is to capture primary cancers of the lung, i.e. those ariving from lung tissue itself, as opposed to cancers that metastasize to the lung from another primary origin (e.g. breast, colon, kidney, etc.).

Whether or not the bronchi should be considered part of the lung is somewhat debatable.  SNOMED CT's anatomical hierarchy places the bronchi in the hierarchy of the ""tracheobronchial tree"", which is a sibling to the lung.  However, since most lung cancers arise from the epithelium of the bronchi, and since the bronchi, particulary the fine branches thereof, are conventionally considered to be part of the lung, it seems reasonable to include them in this concept.  That said, cancer of the trachea is generally considered distinct from ""lung cancer"", so will not be included in this concept.

The scope below does not stipulate any specific histopathologic type; Thus, atypical malignancies that are nonetheless primary to the lung (e.g. malignant carcinoid tumor of the lung, or Kaposi's sarcoma of the lung) are in scope.

Included:
1. Malignant neoplasms stated as being primary to the lung and/or bronchus(i), whether located in the lung or elsewhere
2. Malignant neoplasms stated as being of the lung and/or bronchus(i), without specification as to whether they are primary or metastatic (e.g. ""lung cancer"").
3. Carcinoma in situ of lung and/or bronchus(i), since, while such conditions do not necessarily meet the standard histopathologic definition of malignant neoplasm, they can be expected to progress to malignancy in the absence of clinical intervention.

Some variation exists in the exact definition of this phenomenon, and uncertainty as its biological homogeneity and causes, which is reflected in some variation in terminology and classification.  For instance, some standardized terminologies (e.g. SNOMED CT) use the term ""insulin resistance syndrome"" as a synonym of ""metabolic syndrome"", where others (e.g. ICD-10-CM) consider the former to be a distinct diagnostic entity.  For that reason, a fairly stringent approach will be taken to defining this concept and its value sets.

Scope note: The term ""use disorder"" with regard to psychoactive substances has become widespread since its adoption in DSM-5 in 2013.  By design, the phrase is intended to subsume the disease concepts of ""abuse"" and ""dependence"" of a psychoactive substance.  Not all use of a psychoactive substance meets the diagnostic criteria for use disorder, so this value set may not identify all individuals who are known to their health care team to use cocaine.  In addition, the diagnosis of a ""use disorder"" does not definitively indicate current use of the substance, as the diagnosis (with the qualification of ""in remission"") applies to individuals who are abstinent, even on a long-term basis, after having previously met the criteria for the use disorder.","Candidate codes were identified for review based on ""contains"" searches for:

b. Standardized terminologies (e.g. ICD-10-CM) contain concepts that describe carbapenem resistance broadly, not specifying carbapenemase production as the mechanism of carbapenem resistance (and other mechanisms of resistance do exist).

1. Contact with or exposure to hepatitis A virus.
2. Assertion of prior history of hepatitis A infection.

Note: The framing of this concept without reference to the acuity or chronicity of the illness is intentional.  Hepatitis A virus is not known to cause chronic infections, and nearly all illnesses due to hepatitis A are acute infections, which generally resolve within 2-3 months.  A small proportion of patients will have a recurrence of viral activity and/or symptoms within a few months after recovery, which is generally described as ""relapsing hepatitis"".  Since the preponderance of hepatitis A-related illness represent acute infections (rather than relapsing hepatitis), acute hepatitis A is very often described using codes that specify just ""hepatitis A infection"", rather than codes that stipulate ""acute hepatitis A infection"".  Thus, a concept that was tightly scoped to just assertions of ""acute hepatitis A infection"" would omit many cases of acute hepatitis A.  For this reason, Tuva believes that a concept that includes any and all ""hepatitis A infection"" codes would be more useful.","Candidate codes were identified for review based on ""contains"" searches for:

This most often occurs through the process of ""natural menopause"", which typically occurs after age 45, but also includes ""early menopause"" (generally defined as menopause occurring between 45 and 45 years of age) and ""primary ovarian insufficiency"" (aka ""primary ovarian failure"", generally defined as menopause occurring prior to 40 years of age).  Also, loss of functioning ovarian tissue due to destruction or removal of the ovaries (e.g. from surgery or a disease process) has very similar physiologic characteristics and is thus included in the scope of this concept.

""Perimenopause"" describes a gradual transition between regular menstrual cycles and menopause, and generally extends over several years.  Symptoms typical for perimenopause (e.g. vasomotor symptoms) may persist during menopause.
